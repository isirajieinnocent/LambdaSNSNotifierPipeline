<h1>Project Overview</h1>
This project showcases my ability to design and implement a serverless data processing pipeline using AWS services. It automates the ingestion, validation, and categorization of billing data uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket, ensuring error handling and real-time notifications.


<h1>Solution Overview</h1>
AWS Lambda validates CSV files upon upload, checking:

Date formats (YYYY-MM-DD).

Product categories (e.g., Bakery, Meat).

Accepted currencies (USD, CAD, EUR).

Error Handling:

Invalid files are moved to an Error Bucket.

Issues are reported via AWS SNS notifications for immediate resolution.

File Categorization:

Valid files are transferred to a Processed Bucket.

Original files are deleted post-processing.

### Key Technologies
AWS S3: Storage and event triggers.

AWS Lambda: File validation and processing.

AWS SNS: Real-time error notifications.

Python & Boto3: Implementation of business logic.

Impact
Error Mitigation: Real-time SNS alerts improve transparency and reduce downtime.

Scalability: Serverless design adapts to varying data loads.

Efficiency: Automates a manual, error-prone process, freeing up resources.

Key Achievements
Designed a scalable serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and S3.

Implemented real-time error reporting with AWS SNS.

Automated billing data validation and processing, reducing manual effort.
