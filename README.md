This project showcases my ability to design and implement a serverless data processing pipeline using AWS services. 
It automates the ingestion, validation, and categorization of billing data uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket while ensuring error handling and notification capabilities.
Here’s a high-level summary of the workflow and impact:

Problem Statement:
Organizations handling billing data need reliable systems to validate, process, and categorize it. Manual error detection and notification oversight lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inaccuracies. 
This project addresses these challenges by building an automated and scalable solution.

Solution Overview:
Automation via AWS Lambda:

When billing data is uploaded to S3, it triggers a Lambda function.
The function parses the uploaded CSV file and performs field-level validations:
Ensures dates are in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD).
Confirms product categories belong to pre-defined categories (e.g., Bakery, Meat).
Validates accepted currencies (USD, CAD, EUR).
Error Handling:

Invalid files are moved to a designated Error Bucket for further review.
Issues like API failures for fetching international tax rates are reported via AWS SNS notifications to the relevant teams.
File Categorization:

Valid files are transferred to a Processed Bucket.
The original files are deleted after successful validation or error routing.
Technical Stack:
AWS S3: Stores raw billing data and serves as a trigger for the Lambda function.
AWS Lambda: Implements the business logic for validation and error handling.
AWS SNS: Sends notifications about API failures or processing issues to ensure real-time visibility.
Python with Boto3: Leverages the AWS SDK for implementation.
Key Achievements:
Error Mitigation: The solution ensures immediate feedback through SNS alerts, reducing downtime and improving operational transparency.
Scalability: The serverless design using AWS Lambda adapts to varying file sizes and data loads.
Efficiency: Automates a previously manual and error-prone process, freeing up resources for more critical tasks.
This project is an excellent example of how I utilize AWS services to build robust, scalable, and efficient cloud-based solutions. It highlights my skills in serverless architecture, Python programming, and system integration. Would you like more details about the technical implementation or its real-world applications?



Here’s a detailed explanation of the technical implementation and real-world applications of the project:

Technical Implementation:
File Upload and Event Trigger:

Billing data in CSV files is uploaded to an S3 bucket (Billing Bucket).
S3’s event notification system triggers the Lambda function to start processing the file.

Data Validation Logic:

File Parsing:
The Lambda function downloads the CSV file using the Boto3 S3 client.
It reads the file contents, decodes it, and parses the data row-by-row.
Field Validations:
Ensures dates are formatted correctly using Python’s datetime module.
Confirms product categories and currencies match pre-defined valid lists.
Detects missing or invalid data that might compromise downstream processes.
Custom Error Handling:
Files failing validation are flagged, and the error message specifies the issue (e.g., “Incorrect date format” or “Unrecognized product line”).

API Integration:
Simulates an integration with an external International Taxes API to fetch tax rates for further processing.
Implements error handling to capture API unavailability. This is a placeholder for integrating with real-world APIs in future enhancements.
Error Reporting via SNS:

Errors like API failures are immediately reported using AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS).
A pre-configured SNS topic sends email or SMS notifications to stakeholders, ensuring timely resolution.

File Categorization:
Valid Files: Moved to a Processed Bucket for further use.
Invalid Files: Copied to an Error Bucket for debugging and corrective actions.
Both operations delete the original files from the billing bucket, ensuring data hygiene.

Scalable Serverless Architecture:
The Lambda function scales automatically based on file uploads, ensuring no bottlenecks.
No infrastructure management is required, making the solution cost-efficient and highly available.






In summary 
The project automates the ingestion, validation, and processing of billing data stored in Amazon S3. 
It provides a robust error-handling mechanism and leverages AWS SNS for real-time notifications on issues such as API failures or invalid data formats.
